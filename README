chat.py
-------

chat.py is a bare minimum chat server built on web.py. It uses AJAX to post
messages, and the new messages are pushed to the clients via the "longpoll"
variant of Reverse AJAX.

This program was created as an experiment, but may also be used as a tutorial.
It is available under the GPL, see COPYING.
